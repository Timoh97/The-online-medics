    <main>Online doctors see and treat patients virtually using telehealth. With virtual doctor visits, you can see a doctor online and get medical advice along with necessary prescriptions.

        Getting care at home with an online doctor appointment is convenient for social distancing, or if you’re short on time, transportation, or child care. While telehealth can’t replace face-to-face medical care entirely, it can break down barriers to accessing health care.
        
        Now more than ever, the patient has the ability to manage their healthcare from home with support from healthcare professionals, “It is an exciting time for patients and 
        providers alike to extend quality care to patients in the preferred fashion.”<br>
    Moreover Tim online Medics provide a variety of services physically within the premises. Visit us
and get to interact with our staff.</main>

             <p>"My general experience about online Medics Hospital was amazing, 
                 considering the fact that I came alone from Switzerland. 
                 Every member of staff from reception, admission, nurses, doctors, 
                 catering and other departments I met were excellent. 
                 Thank you for looking after me. The hospital is well organized and
                  treats patients with dignity and respect. 
                  The staff is warm and caring (despite their language
                   barrier in communication).
                   It counts so much when you are worried and not well. 
                 I would recommend this to all those in need of treatment."</p>
